#single trial of the hand priming data in R
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
"1. Remind yourselves what we did in the study and what we expected and why.
2. Load one trial of your choice into R. The four columns refer to: sample, condition, x and y.
3. Plot x against y.
4. Map the y data to a more intuitive screen output with 0/0 in the lower left corner and where
upwards movements are increasingly positive (i.e. so that it looks like the movements we made
on the screen).
5. Calculate the distance travelled (for x and y combined). (The euclidian distance - If you were to add a third dimension you could add a third parameter - Z)
6. Add a time vector. I forgot to measure time so I had to estimate it post-hoc (fine for this exercise,
not great if it was a real experiment). We can assume that each sample takes .0025 s.
7. Calculate velocity and acceleration for y, i.e. vertical movement. Remember: Velocity = distance
difference / time difference. Acceleration = velocity difference / time difference.
8. Play around with some filter to smoothen velocity and acceleration (most common: Butterworth
filter)

data$velextreme <- ifelse(data$velocity < 20 & data$velocity > -20, 1,0)
# derivative of velocity is acceleration => the local maxima and minima are at those points where the derivative is 0


ggplot(data) +
  geom_point( aes(x_center,y_center, color = factor(velextreme), size = velextreme)) + 
  # plot by this factor, you get the zero crossing plotted in the different color
  labs(x = "Trajectory", y = "Height")

localmax <- max(data$y_center[2200:2400])
which(data$y_center == 267.336) # 2350
data$colorvel<- ifelse(data$y_center == localmax ,1,0)

ggplot(data) +
  geom_point( aes(x_center,y_center, size = colorvel, color = factor(colorvel))) + 
  #geom_point( aes(x_center,y_center, size = factor(velextreme))) +
  # plot by this factor, you get the zero crossing plotted in the different color
  labs(x = "Trajectory", y = "Height") +

"
9. Using zero crossings in the acceleration, calculate velocity extreme values (maxima and minima - Dots at the buttom and top of slopes).
Mark those extreme values on top of the x/y plot you made earlier.
10. Using e.g. a range of x positions, specify a segment during which the critical movement happens, (not just the global maxima - we're interested in the local maxima when ever people speed up in acceleration)
i.e. the 6th movement is what we would want to compare in this study. Mark the peak in that segment in a different color."

#If people are having messy data, where they might move a bit back over the old trajectory - one could make a more strict experiemental setup
#these data have very high variability when one look at all the movement patterns
